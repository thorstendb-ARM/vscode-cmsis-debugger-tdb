# Change Log

## 1.3.0

- Enhanced [pyOCD](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/YML-Input-Format/#pyocd)
and [J-Link GDB Server](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/YML-Input-Format/#j-link-server) debug configurations for multi-core
debug, semihosting serial I/O via Telnet, and more.
- Includes updated pyOCD distribution ([pyOCD v0.42.0](https://github.com/pyocd/pyOCD/releases/tag/v0.42.0))
    - Adds [`run`](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/pyOCD-Debugger/#command-line-invocation) subcommand capable of running targets until a time limit or EOT (suited for CI/CD workflows), and of semihosting console output/input and SWV output.
    - Adds support for Cortex-M52 and Star-MC3 based devices ([@Liu-Gu](https://github.com/Liu-Gu)).
    - Improves [CMSIS-Toolbox Run and Debug Management](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/YML-CBuild-Format/#run-and-debug-management) support:
        - Port assignment logic for multi-core GDB server and telnet configurations.
